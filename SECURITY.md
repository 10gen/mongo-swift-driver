## Disclosing a Vulnerability
If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in this library, or are aware of a vulnerability you believe might affect this library, please get in touch!

MongoDB the company has a [process](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report/) in place for reporting vulnerabilities in all MongoDB projects, which include this library. Please review that page for the most up-to-date information on the process and how to get in touch.

**Please do not open a SWIFT Jira ticket or GitHub issue, as these are publicly viewable.**

As this library is taking part in the Swift Server Work Group (SSWG) incubation process, also note the following: 
* Vulnerabilities found in this library will be privately reported to the [Swift Server Work Group](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg) as per their [security guidelines](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/main/security/package-maintainer-received-vulnerability-report.md) within 10 days of the report.
* Once vulnerabilities are fixed and released, vulnerabilities will also be announced in the Swift Forums [Server > Security Updates](https://forums.swift.org/c/server/security-updates) area.
