## Contributing

Before creating a new issue, look at current and past issues both on Github
**AND** MongoDB JIRA. Also look at outstanding PRs, and overall, ensure that
the issue hasn't already been reported. In particular, MongoDB's JIRA has, at
the time of writing this, most of the active development information on this
driver.

If you decide that your issue truly is unique and new, then please follow the
guidelines for submitting an issue, for which there is a template (you'll see
this template when you go to create the issue). Make sure to write in clear and
easy-to-understand English. Your issue is more likely to be resolved quicker if
the maintainers and contributors of this project can understand what you are
saying.
