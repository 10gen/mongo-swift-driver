<!--
Thanks for contributing!

Some things to make sure you've done:
* Ran `swiftlint` and ensured that your additions/deletions are not causing any
new warnings or errors.
* You did _not_ include any changes to the generated documentation (we update
the documentation as part of a separate commit).
* If you added new functionality, then you've added new tests that correctly
verify its correctness.
* You ran `make test` and ensured that the driver still passes all of its
pre-existing tests.
* You read `CONTRIBUTING.md`!

Thanks again!
