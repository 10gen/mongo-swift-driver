# VaporExample

This is a minimal working example of using the driver in a Vapor application.

To test it out, do the following:
1. Run `mongod` to start MongoDB running on `localhost:27017`.
1. Navigate to the root directory of this example in your terminal.
1. Run `../loadExampleData.sh` to load sample data into the database.
1. Run `swift run`.
1. Navigate to `localhost:8080/kittens` to see the example data loaded on the web page.
